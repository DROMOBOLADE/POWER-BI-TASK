# POWER-BI-TASK

## Introduction
***

This is a simple Microsoft Power BI task which is meant to merge 3 tables of (Department, Employee and Salary) together as one table which is named "Staff Bio-Data" here**. 

**_Disclaimer_** : _This task is to understand series of functionalities at the introduction to Microsoft Power BI._
***

## Actions Taken
***
1.	The Department, Employee and Salary Table was imported as CSV files into the desktop.

3.	The Transform data option was used to pull-up the "Power Query Editor"which was used to merge and clean-up this set of data.

5.	The Employee and Salary table was at the first instance merged together, so as to be able to select a common column of employee ID,
     which allowed for this two tables to be merged as one and was named "First Merged Table".

## Skills/Concepts demonstrated

***
The following Microsoft Power BI characteristics were incorporated:

- Importing CSV files from given datasets.
  
- Loading, Transforming and Cleaning data using the Transform data option that leads into "Power Query Editor"
  
- Splitting the Date of Birth column into 3 columns using the 'Split-Up'function.
  
- Merged column function was used to merge this 3 splitted columns into 1 - This is to allow to select the required date format recognized by Power BI, whhich is YYYY-MM-DD.
  
- An additional column (from the add-column tab) was included to create the 'Total Salary' which was addition of the 'Base'and 'yearly increment'.

- The 2-Name columns was merged to have 'Full Name' column, to make for more tidy data.

## Conclusion: 
***
1.	This is a practice-task. 
**

## Recommendation: 
***
For very in-depth analysis, every measurable parameter can be explored and a deep inference can be reached with this data set.
